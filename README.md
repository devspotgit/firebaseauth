# firebaseauth

This is simple project that describes how to handle authentication with **firebase web SDK**.

The app is implementing **Email and Password** based authentication, and third party authentication through **Google and Github**.

The app is using **Vite** as modules bundler to allow firebase to run on the client. 

The app is using only **Vanilla Js**, we refrained on using any framework for the sake on focusing only learning how to handle firebase authentication for web app.

This project can be used as base for any web app that relies on firebase service.
